Description: Provides a set of exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools for 
    visualizing trends, diagnosing data types for beginner-friendly workflows, 
    and automatically routing to suitable statistical tests or trend exploration 
    models. Includes unified plotting functions for trend lines, grouped boxplots, 
    and comparative scatterplots; automated statistical testing (e.g., t-test, 
    Wilcoxon, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Tukey, Dunn) with optional effect size 
    calculation; and model-based trend analysis using generalized additive 
    models (GAM) for count data, generalized linear models (GLM) for continuous 
    data, and zero-inflated models (ZIP/ZINB) for count data with potential 
    zero-inflation. Also supports time-window continuity checks, cross-year 
    handling in `compare_monthly_cases()`, and ARIMA-ready preparation with 
    stationarity diagnostics, ensuring consistent parameter styles for 
    reproducible research and user-friendly workflows.
